# SheepCounter
Imagine a flock of sheep, one by one moving in and out of a fenced grassland. 
Now the shepherd wants a device attached to the fence door that keeps track of the number of sheep inside the land.

Sheep Counter made using Tinkercad:





Components Used- arduino uno r3 microcontroller, 2 PIR Sensors, breadboard





Principle:


The PIR sensors help to detect when the sheep crosses the fence.






~When the sheep crosses PIR1 and then crosses PIR2 after 3 seconds, the number of sheeps inside the fence is increased by 1.






~When the sheep crosses PIR2 and then crosses PIR1, the number of sheeps inside the fence is decreased by 1.
